# aMember v4.x PHP Requirements

Download and place 'requirements.php' & '.htaccess' anywhere on your webhost, preferably in an empty directory. 

To run as a web page open http://example.com/test/requirements.php in your browser (replace the URL as required)
To run from the CLI enter 'php requirements.php'  <-- (note CLI not really 100% reliable)

All items should have a green tick, if not you have an issue with your PHP configuration.
